# EEC-IV-SD44-47

This is a project that is starting off as Kicad files, but may evolve into assembly stuff or XDFs as well.

This is a complete clean-room reverse-engineering of the board and it's component dimensions, The reason I am working on this is to make it easier for pinpoint diagnosis because these SD4x PCms are failing at a pretty quick rate these days.

One day I may build files for other style EEC-IVs, like EFI-SD36E, or EFI-SD21E, and so on.

Donations welcome, as in sending me some EEC-IV PCMs lol I am lacking in the EFI-SD4x category, but am really interested in '94-'95 MAF SFI truck 4.9/5.0/5.8 EEC-IVs, and 7.5L batch fire EEC-IV or MAF EEC-V PCMs.

Doing this in spare time and when motivated, so progress may be slow.
